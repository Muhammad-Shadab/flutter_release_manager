- Auto-detect app name from `pubspec.yaml` (converted to PascalCase)

- Show a pre-build summary and require confirmation before starting
- Show all testing URLs together in a final summary after build completes
- Fix: CLI flags `--rclone-remote`, `--scheme`, `--export-method` now correctly override saved config
- Fix: error messages now always show both example values and the fix instruction
- Fix: invalid menu choices now retry instead of exiting
- Fix: upload `arm64-v8a` APK (modern devices) with fallback to `armeabi-v7a`
- Fix: auto-discover `.xcworkspace` file in `ios/` instead of hardcoding `Runner.xcworkspace`
